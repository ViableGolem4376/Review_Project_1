Group Names: Matthew Langton

Project Summary: 
This project is a grade calculator program which will allow a user to enter their name along with the grades of assignments they have received throughout a semester and then have the program calculate an average grade for them.

Flowchart for Planning:

Algorithm Description:
This program uses a simple algorithm that takes input from a user, puts that input into an input file, calculates an average of the input from the user, and repeats this process until either the program hits a point limit of 100 (to prevent a user from scoring above a 100 in a class) or they decide to stop entering grades. The program accepts inputs of string values for the person's name and then doubles for any grade inputs, these inputs are translated into a grading file that is given to the user upon finishing data input.

Development like this was important because it creates a simple, effective way to run a grading program which can be used easily by anyone.
